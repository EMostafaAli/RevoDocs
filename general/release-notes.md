# Release notes

### \[1.6.0\] - 2019-?-?

#### Added

#### Changed

#### Fixed

### \[1.5.0\] - 2019-01-10

#### Added

* automatic event projector discovery and registration \(now enabled by default\)
* event publishing for non-event sourced entities \(not transactionally safe and not saving to event store yet, though, so beware\)
* coordinated UoW transaction for EF Core including synchronous projections, publishing events from projections and fast event queue dispatching
* EFCoreInMemoryCrudRepository and EFCoreInMemoryDatabaseAccess
* recurring job scheduling support

#### Fixed

* optimized event queue dispatching for big amounts of queues
* ODataAsyncResultFilter.DefaultConverter now returns correct counts
* fixed BasicDomainModelConvention when using inheritance including abstract types
* fixed binding of Hangfire and infrastructure configuration sections, added more options

### \[1.4.0\] - 2018-11-05

#### Added

* [\#1](https://github.com/revoframework/Revo/issues/1) **ASP.NET Core support** - platform implementation, i.e. user context, security, DI, OData, etc.
* [\#2](https://github.com/revoframework/Revo/issues/2), [\#3](https://github.com/revoframework/Revo/issues/3) **EF Core support** - data access & infrastructure \(async events, sagas, projections...\)
* Throttling async event processing to minimize the amount of running tasks and open DB connections \(when running event queue catch-ups during app start-up and pseudo-synchronously processing events after a request; see IAsyncEventPipelineConfiguration\)

#### Changed

* **flattened and simplified package structure** \(now provider-centric\) - vendor-specific modules were moved to Providers directory and some of them were merged/renamed:
  * _Revo.Platforms.AspNet → Revo.AspNet_
  * _Revo.DataAccess.EF6 and Revo.Infrastructure.EF6 → Revo.EF6_
  * _Revo.DataAccess.RavenDB → Revo.RavenDB_
  * _Revo.Integrations.Rebus → Revo.Rebus_
* **improved AsyncEventWorker concurrency** - framework did not prevent multiple workers from parallel processing of one async event queue, causing occasional \(e.g. when under heavy load\) concurrency exceptions \(which are eventually handled by an automatic retry\); now allowing only one active worker per a queue in an application instance
* **Ninject binding extensions InRequestOrJobScope** is now two separate methods with corresponding fallbacks in order - InTaskScope \(mostly preferred\) and InRequestScope

#### Removed

* **IAutoMapperDefinition** - removed as obsolete and replaced with AutoMapper's own profiles \(auto-discovered again\)
* **removed implicit ASP.NET Web API configuration** - i.e. default OData and serializer settings
* **TokenValidator** - removed as obsolete
* **\(Tenant\)ContextSequence** - removed \(possibly to be reimplemented later\)

#### Fixed

* **CRUD repositories** now correctly wrap their **concurrency exceptions as OptimisticConcurrencyException**
* **objects from DI container** are now deterministically disposed at the end of tasks run within a context \(also reducing amount of unused open DB connection\)
* **Hangfire job task context disposal** now correctly awaits the command to finish

### \[1.3.0\] - 2018-08-31

#### Fixed

* **EF6SagaMetadataRepository** bug not including the keys in a query
* **EF6 saga keys** not being reloaded correctly due to JSON serialization changing dictionary key character cases
* **ExecuteCommandJob** is now resolved correctly by Hangfire

#### Added

* **\(I\)UserPermissionAuthorizer** for manual and more fine-grained user action authorization
* **EF6/EntityEventProjector** for more arbitrary projections

#### Changed

* framework configuration - framework and its module parameters now need to be programmatically configured and set-up using the newly introduced **RevoConfiguration**
* **PermissionAuthorizer** renamed to PermissionAuthorizationMatcher
* **Default ASP.NET Web API JSON ContractResolver** switched to DefaultContractResolver with CamelCaseNamingStrategy from CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver \(matches default ASP.NET Core behavior and does not change dictionary key character cases\)
* Hangfire integration for background job processing got its own **Revo.Infrastructure.Hangfire** package

### \[1.2.0\] - 2018-07-16

* First public version released.
